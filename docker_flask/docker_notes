- create a folder docker_flask
 - app.py
 - Dockerfile --> here the image code will be written --> python:3.10-slim reduces size of image
 - create requriements.txt --> pip freeze> requirements.txt

- docker build -t flask_b14 . --> this will build your image in docket texttop app in Images section
 - by defualt the image's tag will be latest if you do not give any version at the time of building
 - docker build -t flask_b14:1 . --> will create image as flask_b14:1
 - click on image --> analyse --> will give details about it, all the commands etc.

- docker build -t flask_b14 . --> docker build -t tage_name:version .

 - docker images --> lists down all the images

 - docker run -p 5000:5000 image_name --> to run image --> 5000 is local desk port and docker's por
  - this pushes your image in container and container will be in running state
  - heuristic_mccarthy - random name is generated --> takes scientists names
  - ctrl+c --> breaks the run at console --> results in stopping of container at docker desk

- click on image(b14_flask) --> run --> additional settings --> container name --> port
  - do not use 5000 port or else your container won't work --> error 500 --> I used 5001
  - if you don't name continer simply run --> it will take a random name

- docker ps --> lists down all the running containers
- docker ps -a --> lists down all the active and inactive containers

- click on container --> files --> edit app.py --> change message --> save --> refresh --> 
  --> click on url --> new message will display 
  - if you do this procedure with your duplciate containers that you have creted
  changes won't refelect in the url 
- changes in live container is just foir tetsing purpose not recommended
- whatever change you make has to be done in your app.py 
- for every chnage you need to build a new image

- docker stop container_id --> to stop any container from console 
- docker start container_id  --> to start any container from console

- docker rm container_id
- docker rmi image_id (all the containers associated to any image have to be dleeted first)
